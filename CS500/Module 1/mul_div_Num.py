# Write a Python program to find the multiplication and division of two numbers.

# Ask the user to input two numbers (num1 and num2). 
# Given those two numbers, multiply them together to find the output. 
# Also, divide num1/num2 to find the output.

# Get the user input 
num1  = int(input('Enter 1st number: '))
num2  = int(input('Enter 2nd number: '))

# Prints Multiplication of two numbers
print('The Multiplication of', num1 , 'and', num2, 'is', num1 *num2 )

# Prints Divion of 1st number by 2nd Number
print('The Division of', num1  ,'by', num2, 'is', num1 /num2 )
